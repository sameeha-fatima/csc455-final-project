## Abstract
The escalating concern surrounding the mental health of college students has become more pronounced, particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. While the measures implemented to curb the spread of the virus, such as remote classes and social distancing were effective in mitigating the transmission of COVID-19, they concurrently intensified feelings of loneliness among college students. Illustratively, according to The News & Observer, during the academic year 2021-2022, half of the student body at NC State reported experiencing “moderate psychological distress” on a regular basis [1]. And tragically, seven N.C. State students died from suicide within the same academic year [2]. These distressing statistics underscore the presence of a mental health crisis in N.C. State, emphasizing the imperative need for a solution that assures college students that help is available for those grappling with signs of depression. Addressing this issue holds the potential to save lives.
In today's digital age, where virtually everyone is connected online and to their smartphones, numerous apps have emerged in the market with the aim of addressing the mental health crisis. One pivotal source from the literature “Creating a Digital Health Smartphone App and Digital Phenotyping Platform for Mental Health and Diverse Healthcare Needs: an Interdisciplinary and Collaborative Approach,” [3] delves into strategies for developing a novel digital psychiatry clinic that seamlessly integrates clinical research and patient communities into a unified app. The insights gleaned from this literature provide valuable guidance on techniques to actively encourage users to seek mental health resources and help when needed. 
However, a notable challenge associated with developing such apps lies in the substantial effort and resources required to build, launch, and market an app, with no guarantee of success. This report proposes a critical and innovative approach: building a realistic simulation of persuasion within society. The rationale behind this approach is that if a sufficiently accurate simulation can be created, it would significantly reduce the resources needed for testing new approaches to tackling the mental health crisis.
